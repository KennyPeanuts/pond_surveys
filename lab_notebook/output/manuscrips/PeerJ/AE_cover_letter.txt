Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript "Leaf litter density and decomposition in small man-made ponds" for publication in Aquatic Ecology. Our paper shows that small man-made ponds contain abundant terrestrial leaf litter and that this organic matter source decomposes slowly. Given that small ponds are a very abundant alteration to watersheds in many parts of the world, our results indicate that small man-made ponds could represent an important alteration to organic matter cycling in watershed where they occur. Our findings are especially important because the impact of small ponds in general, and small man-made ponds especially on ecosystem processes have not received much study. Our study is only one of few estimates of the density of leaf litter within ponds and since leaf litter represents a key resource to many freshwater communities, having data on its abundance is important for understanding energy flow in pond ecosystems.

Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication and we look forward to your feedback.
