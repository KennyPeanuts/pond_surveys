### Description

The data used to determine the LOI for the CPOM collected from Daulton Pond.  The detailed sampling notes can be found in [https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/Daulton_Pond_Sampling_14Jun2016.md](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/Daulton_Pond_Sampling_14Jun2016.md).

Briefly:

For the open (O) and near-littoral (NL) sites, cores (4.7 cm diam.) were collected with a KP corer at each site. The cores were extruded upwards in 1 cm increments and then sliced into a 1 mm sieve. Any material that was retained by the sieve was considered CPOM and was transferred to a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and then dried at 50 dC. The sediment that passed through the sieve was collected in another 20 ml glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC. 

Following the determination of dry mass, the sediments and CPOM were ashed for 5 h at 550 dC and AFDM was determined as the difference between the mass of the dry sample and the mass of the ash.

NOTE: Only the open and near-littoral CPOM data are recorded in this file. The sediment data are found in [https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/data/DP_Sed_LOI.csv](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/data/DP_Sed_LOI.csv)

## Variables

* Pond = the abbreviation for the pond name
  * DP = Daulton Pond
  
* Date = the date the field sampling was completed (YYYY-MM-DD)

* CPOM.Type = the type of site the core was taken from
  * O = Open water
  * NL = Near littoral 
  
* CPOM.Core = the letter that was assigned to the core sample 

* Z = how much was sampled from the core (cm)

* SedDepth = the starting depth of the core that was sampled (cm) 

* VialNum = the number vial that was used for the sample

* VialMass = the weight of the vial (g)

* VialDryCPOM = the weight of the vial and CPOM dry mass (g)

* VialAM = the weight of the vial and ash mass (g)
