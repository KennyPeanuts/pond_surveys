  * NL = Near littoral 
  * L = Littoral
  
* OM.Core = the letter that was assigned to the core sample 

* Z = how much was sampled from the core (cm)

* SedDepth = the starting depth of the core that was sampled (cm) 

* VialNum = the number vial that was used for the sample

* VialMass = the weight of the vial (g)

* VialWetOM = the weigh of the vial and wet sediment (g)
