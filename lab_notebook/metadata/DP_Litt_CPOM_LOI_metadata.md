### Description

These samples were collected to determine the LOI of CPOM in the littoral portions of Daulton Pond. The sampling notes can be found in [https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/Daulton_Pond_Sampling_22Jun2016.md](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/Daulton_Pond_Sampling_22Jun2016.md).

Briefly:

In three littoral locations around the pond the organic matter of the littoral zone was sampled by placing a Hess Sampler (32.5 cm diam.) into the benthos of the littoral zone approximately 2 m from the shore, taking care to work between the vegetation.

Once the sampler was in place, we removed all the CPOM on the surface of the sediments down to the sediment layer or down approximately 10 cm if the sediment layer was not obvious. 

The removed CPOM was placed into a resealable plastic bag and returned to the lab on ice where it was placed in the refrigerator for 48 h prior to sorting and sampling. The samples were then gently rinsed and sorted into "terrestrial litter", "reed litter", or "typha litter" and then dried in a pre-weighed paper bag at 50 dC for >48 h. Once dry the litter was ground and placed into pre-weighed ceramic crucibles and ashed at 550 dC for >4 h to determine LOI.

NOTE: These data are only for the LOI determination. The litter standing stock data can be found []().

## Variables

* Pond = the abbreviation for the pond name
  * DP = Daulton Pond
  
* Date = the date the field sampling was completed (YYYY-MM-DD)

* Site = the area that the sample was taken from
  * A = Cattails
  * B = Open
  * C = Reed
  
* OM.Type = type of OM that was found in the sample
  * T = Terrestrial
