### Description

The data used to determine the LOI for the sediments collected from Daulton Pond.  The detailed sampling notes can be found in [https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/Daulton_Pond_Sampling_14Jun2016.md](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/Daulton_Pond_Sampling_14Jun2016.md).

Briefly:

For the open (O) and near-littoral (NL) sites, cores (4.7 cm diam.) were collected with a KP corer at each site. The cores were extruded upwards in 1 cm increments and then sliced into a 1 mm sieve. Any material that was retained by the sieve was considered CPOM and was transferred to a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and then dried at 50 dC. The sediment that passed through the sieve was collected in another 20 ml glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC. 

For the Littoral (L) sites, core tube (4.7 cm diam.) was inserted into the sediments of the littoral zone, avoiding the vegetation as much as possible. From within this sampler, a 0.8 cm diam. X 1 cm deep core of the soft sediments was collected and added to a pre-weighed ceramic crucible.

Following the determination of dry mass, the sediments and CPOM were ashed for 5 h at 550 dC and AFDM was determined as the difference between the mass of the dry sample and the mass of the ash.

NOTE: Only the sediment data are recorded in this file. The CPOM data are found in [https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/data/DP_CPOM_LOI.csv](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/data/DP_CPOM_LOI.csv) and [https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/data/DP_Litt_CPOM_LOI.csv](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/pond_surveys/blob/master/lab_notebook/data/DP_Litt_CPOM_LOI.csv)
