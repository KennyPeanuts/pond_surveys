# Metadata for the survey sampling of the ponds

## Description

These data are part of the regular sampling of the ponds for basic physical and chemical parameters.

The temperature, conductivity, and DO data were collected with a YSI 600OMS V2 sonde with a optical DO meter

pH was measured in the lab on samples collected in the field with a acumet AB15 pH meter

light was measured with a LiCor 2-pi underwater cell

## Data File 

* 'pond_surveys.csv'

## Variables

* Pond = the abbreviation for the pond name
  * DP = Daulton Pond
  * LPP = Lancer Park Pond

* Date = the date the field sampling was completed (YYYY-MM-DD)

* Water.Z = the depth of the water where the sample was measured (m)

* Temp = the temperature of the water (dC)

* Cond.mS = the conductivity in mS / cm

* Cond.us = the conductivity in &mu;S / cm

* percDO = the percent of dissolved oxygen saturation

* conc.DO = the concentration of dissolved oxygen in mg / L

* Light = the irradiance in &mu;mol / s / m^2

* pH = the pH of the water

* Secci = the depth at which the secci disc was no longer visible when lowered over the sunny side of the boat
