## Field Notes

### 13 July 2016

#### General Observations 

The pond looked typical of the way it always does, the water was browninsh and there was a thin film of pollen? or other OM on the surface. 

There was water flowing in both the inlet and outlet.

#### Water Sampling

The secci depth was 0.6 m

The maximum depth that we found was approximately 1.2 m.

We collected water from about 10 cm below the surface for the EPI sample and at 1.0 m for the HYPO sample.

We did a light and YSI profile (see data)

#### Coring 

We collected 3 KB cores from the open water.

I did not take notes on the appearance of the cores.

* Core A was collected in 1.2 m of water along the center of the N-S axis of the pond, near to the dam.
 
* Core B was collected in the middle of the pond in 1.2 m of water.

* Core C was collected in 1.0 m of water along the along the center of the N-S axis nearer to the inlet side of the pond. 

#### Core Sampling

The cores were sampled by extruding the core up to the surface of the sediments and removing the last of the overlying water with a syringe or squeezy bulb.

A sample for fungal biomass was collected by taking a 0.8 cm diameter by 1 cm deep core with a cut off pipette. The core sediments were placed in a scintillation vial. 10 ml of MeOH was then added to each sample and it was placed in the freezer. Samples were collected from open cores A, B and C, and from littoral cores A and B, because core C was too short to extract.

A sample for organic matter was taken with the same core and added to a per-weighed glass scintillation vial.

There were no organic matter depth profiles or CPOM measurements taken from the open cores.

#### Littoral Sampling

The littoral samples were collected by placing the Hess sampler approximately 1 m from the shore and then removing the CPOM on the surface sediments by hand. A KB core was then taken adjacent to the Hess sample for fine littoral sediments. The litter collected from each site was placed in a ziploc bag and then returned to the lab on ice. Once back in the lab 5 representative leaves were removed from each sample and 2 #5 (10 mm) discs were cut from each leaf. One disc was added to 10 ml of MeOH. All 5 discs from each site were pooled in to a single MeOH vial to extract for ergosterol. These samples were sealed tightly and then placed in the freezer. The other disc cut from each leaf was dried and ashed for AFDM. The remaining leaves were then dried, ground and ashed for AFDM.

Littoral Ergosterol samples were collected from the litter in each site.

Sample A was taken along the N shore. The littoral zone is completely covered by the tree canopy. The water came about 1/2 way up the Hess sampler and the sediments had a very deep litter layer with no obvious sediment surface.

Sample B was taken along the E shore. The litter layer was very deep and had no obvious sediment surface. The water came up to the Hess lip. There was no canopy and no trees in the adjacent shore, this sample was take next to the flood-plain which was covered in tall grass. 

Sample C was taken along the S shore and was completely covered by the tree canopy. The litter layer was shallow and there was an obvious and hard (scoured) sediment surface. The water level was 1/2 way up the Hess.


#### Lab Procedures

The pH of water sample was measured on the lab pH meter

The water sample was then passed through a GFF filter to collect seston for chlorophyll the filtrate was collected for:

For the EPI and HYPO samples:

  * 10 ml into a 15 ml falcon tube for spec scans -> refrigerated 
  * 30 ml into 50 ml glass pre-ashed vials for DOC -> added 300 ul of 2N HCl 
  * 30 ml into 50 ml falcon tube for nutrients -> frozen

The total volume filtered for the chlorophyll was: EPI = 150 ml, HYPO = 130 ml

The filters were then placed into 15 ml falcon tubes covered in foil, we then added 10 ml of 90% acetone and placed in the freezer. 

The filters were "mashed" with a metal spatula approximately halfway through the extraction.

The organic matter samples collected from the cores were weighed wet and then dried at 50 dc and reweighed, finally they were ashed at 550 dC for >4 h to determine AFDM
