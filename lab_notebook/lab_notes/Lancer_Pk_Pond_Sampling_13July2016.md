## Field Notes

### 11 July 2016

#### General Observations 

The water is a scuzzy pea-green with silvery oily slicks on the surface

The sandbar at the inlet smells strongly of ammonia and is covered in duck/goose poop

There are 13 ducks on the pond (mallards) while we were sampling

The pond is bubbling regularly and in no particular place. The bubbles arise all over.

There is a slow flow in the inlet at the time of the sampling.

#### Water Sampling

The secci depth was 0.2 m

The maximum depth that we found was approximately 0.7 m and most of the pond was about 0.5 m deep. The area near the inlet was very shallow.

We collected water from about 10 cm below the surface.

We did a light and YSI profile (see data)

#### Coring 

We collected 3 KB cores from the open water.

* Core A was collected from 0.7 m of water near the midline of the lake on the W side of the lake. The core was a uniform dark gray fine sediments with some sandiness to it. There were noticeable bubbles in the core.
 
* Core B was collected in the middle of the pond in 0.5 m of water. The core was similar to core A in appearance  

* Core C was collected along the middle of the pond nearer to the inlet in 0.5 m of water. The core was similar in appearance to core A.

#### Core Sampling

The cores were sampled by extruding the core up to the surface of the sediments and removing the last of the overlying water with a syringe or squeezy bulb.

A sample for fungal biomass was collected by taking a 0.8 cm diameter by 1 cm deep core with a cut off pipette. The core sediments were placed in a scintillation vial on ice.

A sample for organic matter was taken with the same core and added to a per-weighed glass scintillation vial.

The upper 1 cm of sediments was then removed by scooping out the sediments and the core extruded upwards.

The removed sediments were washed through a 1 mm sieve with pond water and any retained organic matter was collected into a glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC.

The above sampling for organic matter was repeated every cm for the upper 4 cm, and every 2 cm for 6 to 12 cm

In each of these cores, the nature of the sediment and the abundance CPOM made it hard to get a quantitative subsample with the pipette below 3 cm.  These samples were collected but were basically scooped out, so the bulk density is unreliable.

##### Core Vial Assignments

| Core | Z (cm)  | OM vial | CPOM vial     |
| ---- | ------  | ------- | ---------     |
| A    | 0 - 1   | D4      | none, no CPOM |
|      | 1 - 2   | D5      | I1            |
|      | 2 - 3   | D6      | I2            |
|      | 3 - 4   | D7      | I3            |
|      | 4 - 6   | D8      | I4            |
|      | 6 - 8   | D9      | I5            |
| B    | 0 - 1   | D10     | I7            |
|      | 1 - 2   | E2      | I8            |
|      | 2 - 3   | E3      | I9            |
|      | 3 - 4   | E4      | I10           |
|      | 4 - 5   | E5      | H1            |
|      | 6 - 8   | E6      | H2            |
| C    | 0 - 1   | E7      | H3            |
|      | 1 - 2   | E8      | H4            |
|      | 2 - 3   | E9      | H5            |
|      | 3 - 4   | E10     | H6            |
|      | 4 - 6   | F1      | H7            |
|      | 6 - 8   | F2      | H8            |

#### Littoral Sampling

The littoral samples were collected by placing the Hess sampler near the wall of the pond and removing leaf litter on the surface of the sediments, however there was no leaf litter on the surface sediments. The sediments were basically CPOM free until about 6 - 10 cm down and then there was a dense CPOM layer. I collected samples from the CPOM layer by fanning fine sediments to expose the CPOM and then grabbing a handful. I collected an ergosterol sample from this litter but not a quantitative OM sample because I could not sample a defined area. The samples were collected along the N, E, and S walls. 

#### Lab Procedures

The pH of water sample was measured on the lab pH meter

The water sample was then passed through a GFF filter to collect seston for chlorophyll the filtrate was collected for:

  * 10 ml into a 15 ml falcon tube for spec scans -> refrigerated 
  * 30 ml into 50 ml glass pre-ashed vials for DOC -> added 300 ul of 2N HCl 
  * 30 ml into 50 ml falcon tube for nutrients -> frozen

The total volume filtered for the chlorophyll was: 30 ml

The filters were then placed into 15 ml falcon tubes covered in foil, we then added 10 ml of 90% acetone and placed in the freezer at 2:30 pm

The filters were "mashed" with a metal spatula approximately halfway through the extraction.

The organic matter samples collected from the cores were weighed wet and then dried at 50 dc and reweighed, finally they were ashed at 550 dC for >4 h to determine AFDM
