These notes describe the field sampling of Daulton Pond for the fungal biomass survey

## Field Notes

### 14 June 2016

The pond had mats of think floating filamentous algae around the entire perimeter. Most of the mats extended out 5 to 10 m from the shore and were held in place by the reed and Typha sp growing in the littoral zone. 

There were 2 mats out in the middle of the pond that were free and drifting (each about 3 - 5 m across).

#### Water Sampling

The secci depth was 1.48 m

The maximum depth that we found was approximately 3 m and was near the dam, although most of the open water was >2 m deep.

We collected water from the Epilimnion at 0.25 m and from the Hypolimnion at 2.5 m

We did a light and YSI profile (see data)

#### Coring 

We collected 4 KB cores from the open water.

* Core A was collected from 3.2 m of water near the W side of the midline of the lake. The core was about 30 cm in length. This core was overall gray in color with some orange marbling toward the bottom. The surface sediments had some green cohesive algal biofilm over flocculent sediments.

* Core B was collected E of core A in 2.1 m of water. This core was only about 15 cm in length. The surface sediments were greenish gray in color and much less consolidated. The deeper sediments were the same color but more consolidated and more clay-like.

* Core C was collected S of core B nearer to the S shore, directly W of the "inlet" in 2.3 m of water. The core was about 25 cm in length with a gray-green algal floc on the surface and flocculent grey-green sediments for most of the core. The deeper sediments were dark grey clay with orange swirled in.

* Core D was collected back near core A on the W side of the lake but closer to the N shore in 2.9 m of water. The core was about 25 cm in length and had green algal flock, somewhat consolidated at the surface with more medium grey flocculent material below. The deeper sediments were light grey clay.

#### Core Sampling

The cores were sampled by extruding the core up to the surface of the sediments and removing the last of the overlying water with a syringe or squeezy bulb.

A sample for fungal biomass was collected by taking a 0.8 cm diameter by 1 cm deep core with a cut off pipette. The core sediments were placed in a scintillation vial on ice.

A sample for organic matter was taken with the same corer and added to a per-weighed glass scintillation vial.

The upper 1 cm of sediments was then removed by scooping out the sediments and the core extruded upwards.

The removed sediments were washed through a 1 mm sieve with pond water and any retained organic matter was collected into a glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC.

The above sampling for organic matter was repeated every cm for the upper 4 cm, and every 2 cm for 6 to 12 cm

#### Lab Procedures

The pH of the epi and hypo water was measured on the lab pH meter

The epi and hypo water was then passed through a GFF filter to collect seston for chlorophyll the filtrate was collected for:

  * 10 ml into a 15 ml falcon tube for spec scans -> refrigerated 
  * 30 ml into 50 ml glass pre-ashed vials for DOC -> added 300 ul of 2N HCl 
  * 30 ml into 50 ml falcon tube for nutrients -> frozen

The epi filter then had an additional 70 ml passed through it and the hypo filter had an addition 50 ml

The total volume filtered for the epi sample was: 185 ml

The total volume filtered for the hypo sample was: 165 ml

The filters were then placed into 15 ml falcon tubes covered in foil, we then added 10 ml of 90% acetone and placed in the freezer at 2:30 pm

At 10:00 AM on 15 June 2016, the filters were "mashed" with a metal spatula.

The organic matter samples collected from the cores were weighed wet and then dried at 50 dc and reweighed, finally they were ashed at 550 dC for >4 h to determine AFDM
