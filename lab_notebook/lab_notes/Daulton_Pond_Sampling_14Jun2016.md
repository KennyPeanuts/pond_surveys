## Description

These notes describe the field sampling of Daulton Pond for the fungal biomass survey

## Field Notes

### 14 June 2016

The pond had mats of think floating filamentous algae around the entire perimeter. Most of the mats extended out 5 to 10 m from the shore and were held in place by the reed and Typha sp growing in the littoral zone. 

There were 2 mats out in the middle of the pond that were free and drifting (each about 3 - 5 m across).

#### Water Sampling

The secci depth was 1.48 m

The maximum depth that we found was approximately 3 m and was near the dam, although most of the open water was >2 m deep.

We collected water from the Epilimnion at 0.25 m and from the Hypolimnion at 2.5 m

We did a light and YSI profile (see data)
