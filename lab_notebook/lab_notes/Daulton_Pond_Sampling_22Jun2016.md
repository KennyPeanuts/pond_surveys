## Field Notes

### 22 June 2016

The floating mats of algae that were bright and green on 14 June 2016, were starting to turn reddish brown and decompose.

#### Water Sampling

The secci depth was 1.25 m

We did not do a YSI or light profile.

#### Coring 

We collected cores from the near littoral section of the pond and the littoral zone.  The near littoral samples were taken just outside the margins of the emergent reed or typha beds, approximately 10 - 15 m from shore. The littoral samples were taken in the wade-able water at the pond margin, approximately 2 m from shore.

I walked the perimeter of the pond to identify the regions of vegetation around the pond. Beginning at the small inlet area on the S side of the pond there is a reed bed that extends to within about 30 m of the dam. The area between the reed bed and the dam is mainly lacking emergent macrophytes and has the greatest canopy overlap. The dam shoreline and the W 1/2 of the N shore is reed.  The E 1/2 of the N shore and the entire E shore is typha.

Near littoral cores were taken with the KB corer

The littoral samples were taken by placing the Hess sampler in a section between the emergent plants and then all of the organic matter on the sediment surface was removed by hand down to the sediment surface.  A core was then taken adjacent to the Hess sampler by pushing a KB core tube into the sediments by hand.  Visual inspection of the cores, suggests that the corer may be under-sampling the surface litter. Cores taken adjacent to the Hess were LOTS of CPOM was removed, showed fairly clear surface sediments. I think the core tube may push out of the way or bury the CPOM on its way in. This may explain the dramatic reduction in CPOM mass between the littoral and near littoral samples.

Cores were collected from 3 sites.

Site A was in the middle of the E shore along the typha bed. The near littoral core was collected about 10 - 15 m from shore, just outside the margin of the typha bed. The water was 1.3 m deep and the core was collected with the KB corer push in by hand. The littoral sampling showed almost all typha litter but the surface sediments that the litter was lying on were fairly obvious. Disturbing the sediments released a lot of bubbles and decomposition odors. The water depth was just above the mesh panel on the Hess sampler. The near littoral core from site A was overall gritty sediments but the upper 9 cm were a loose greenish brown flock and below that the core sediments were dark grey. 

Site B was in the macrophyte-free zone near the dam on the S shore. The near littoral sample was collected about 10 m from shore in 1 m of water. The sediments did not core easily and the core was short (approx 7 cm). The upper 3 cm of the core was a greenish-brown flock and below that the sediments became more grey but were still loose. There are no OM samples from this core because it was lost during transfer to the extruder (we took 2 cores and lost both of them). The littoral sample was about 2 m from shore in water just above the Hess lip. There was no macrophytes and the terrestrial litter layer was at least 3 cm deep. This site produced few bubbles when disturbed and the sediment surface under the litter layer was not obvious, the litter just gradually got less dense and the sediment increased.

Site C was in the reed bed on the S shore. The near littoral core was taken about 10 m from shore in 1.3 m of water. The core was about 14 cm total with the upper 6 cm greenish brown flock and 6 - 10 cm greyish green flock. Below 10 cm the sediments were light grey and mainly clay. The littoral sample was taken about 2 m from shore in water just above the Hess lip. The litter was mostly fragmented and amorphous reed litter with some terrestrial OM. Some bubbles produced when disturbed. The litter was deep, it was very hard to tell where the litter layer ended and sediment layer began.


#### Core Sampling

The near littoral cores were sampled by extruding the core up to the surface of the sediments and removing the last of the overlying water with a syringe or squeezy bulb.

A sample for fungal biomass was collected by taking a 0.8 cm diameter by 1 cm deep core with a cut off pipette. The core sediments were placed in a scintillation vial on ice.

A sample for organic matter was taken with the same corer and added to a per-weighed glass scintillation vial.

The upper 1 cm of sediments was then removed by scooping out the sediments and the core extruded upwards.

The removed sediments were washed through a 1 mm sieve with pond water and any retained organic matter was collected into a glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC.

The above sampling for organic matter was repeated every cm for the upper 4 cm, and every 2 cm for 6 to 12 cm


##### Core Vial Assignments

| ---- | ------  | ------- | --------- |
| A    | 0 - 1   | C2      | H1        |
|      | 1 - 2   | C3      | H2        |

#### Lab Procedures

The littoral cores were brought back to the lab and sampled on 24 June 2016. The cores were extruded and a ergosterol and AFDM sample were taken from the surface sediments as above. No profile was collected because the large CPOM fragments disturbed the core during collection.

The littoral CPOM that was taken from the Hess sampler was taken back to the lab in a zip-loc bag on ice and refrigerated until 24 June 2016, when the contents were rinsed gently with tap water and sorted into "terrestrial litter", "reed", "typha". Each category was then placed into a pre-weighed paper bag and dried at 50 dC. The dried litter was weighed, and then ground with a mortar and pestle and transferred to pre-weighed crucibles to be ashed at 550 dC. Most samples were too large to fit into a single crucible but the total sample was divided and ashed. 
The organic matter samples collected from the cores were weighed wet and then dried at 50 dc and reweighed, finally they were ashed at 550 dC for >4 h to determine AFDM

All of the ergosterol samples were stored on ice and had 10 ml of MeOH added within a couple hours after collection. The samples were then stored in the freezer.
