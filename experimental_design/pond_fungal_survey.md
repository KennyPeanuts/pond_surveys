* file created 13 June 2016 - KF

## Description

The lab leaf decomposition experiment (CPOM_Flux) found the that there was an unexpectedly high amount of fungal biomass in the soft sediments and less fungal biomass than would be expected on the leaf litter itself.  Therefore, we are going to sample several of the local ponds to assess fungal biomass in the ponds in the field.

## Field Procedure
### Littoral (3 samples)

1. Use the Hess sampler to delimit a section of the littoral sediments.

2. Remove all leaf material from the sampler.

3. Select a representative sub-sample of leaf fragments for ergosterol sampling.

4. Place ergosterol samples into a ziploc bag in the cooler.

5. Place the remaining leaf litter in a pre-weighed paper bag.

6. Collect 3, 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment cores from within the Hess sampler and combine the cores into a scintillation vial and place in the cooler. 

7. Collect 3, 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment cores from within the Hess sampler and combine the cores into a pre-weighed scintillation vial for LOI and bulk density.

### Near-Littoral (3 samples)

1. Collect a large (10.2 cm diameter) cores from the near littoral zone of the pond.

2. Extrude each core to access the sediment-water interface and remove any leaf material from the sediment surface.

3. Select a representative sub-sample of leaf fragments for ergosterol sampling.

4. Place ergosterol samples into a ziploc bag in the cooler.

5. Place the remaining leaf litter in a pre-weighed paper bag.

6. Collect 3, 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment cores from the sediments of the core combine the cores into a scintillation vial and place in the cooler. 

7. Collect 3, 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment cores from the sediments of the core combine the cores into a pre-weighed scintillation vial for LOI and bulk density.

8. Extrude core 1 cm and collect any buried leaf litter by passing through 1 mm mesh.

9. Collect 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment core from 1 - 2 cm and place into a pre-weighed scintillation vial for LOI and bulk density.

10. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 10 cm.

### Open water (3 samples)

1. Collect a narrow (4.8 cm diameter) cores from the open water of the pond.

2. Extrude each core to access the sediment-water interface and remove any leaf material from the sediment surface.

3. Select a representative sub-sample of leaf fragments for ergosterol sampling.

4. Place ergosterol samples into a ziploc bag in the cooler.

5. Place the remaining leaf litter in a pre-weighed paper bag.

6. Collect 3, 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment cores from the sediments of the core combine the cores into a scintillation vial and place in the cooler.

7. Collect 3, 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment cores from the sediments of the core combine the cores into a pre-weighed scintillation vial for LOI and bulk density.

8. Extrude core 1 cm and collect any buried leaf litter by passing through 1 mm mesh.


9. Collect 1 cm deep by 0.8 cm diameter sediment core from 1 - 2 cm and place into a pre-weighed scintillation vial for LOI and bulk density.

10. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 10 cm.

## Lab Procedure

1. Punch a no. 5 leaf disc from each of the representative leaf samples from each core and preserve in 10 ml of MeOH and seal with parafilm and place in the freezer.

2. Add 10 ml of MeOH to the sediment samples in the cooler, seal with parafilm and place in freezer.
